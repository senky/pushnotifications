*Item* is Browser and Mobile Notifications Extension by Jakub Senko.

*Website* is a set of related web pages located under a single domain name.

                  of security breach through the public endpoints of the Item.

             of the Item.

                 to the Item.

*Sell* or *Sold* means sell, license, sub-license or distribute for any type
                 of fee or charge.


2. The Extended License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive,
   worldwide license to make use of the Item on five Websites. You are eligible
   to receive the Security, Bug and Feature updates of the Item within next two
   years.

3. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself
   or for one client (a "single application").

4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single
   End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred
   to your client.

5. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works
   and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms
   of this license.

6. You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client. (If you or your client
   want to Sell the End Product, you will need the Reseller License.)

7. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source
   files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other
   items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make
   available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications.

8. You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to customise
   a digital product to their specific needs, such as an “on demand”,
   “made to order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use the Item
   in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product
   incorporating the Item that is created using the application.

9. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components
   before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single
   component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.

    it separately from the End Product.

11. You can’t use an Item in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

12. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes.

13. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop
    making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

14. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on
    these terms for 59 EUR. This license is between the author of the Item and you.

15. You are not eligible for a refund of already purchased license.
